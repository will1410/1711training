## Holds history

When you view the patron's record in the staff client there will be a new tab for Holds History.

Click on the tab that says "Holds history"

## Patron initiated update

If the patron's account is flagged as "Gone no address" by staff and the patron initiates an account update through the OPAC, a flag will now appear on the patron's suggesting updates page showing staff that the "Gone no address" flag has is set for that patron.
