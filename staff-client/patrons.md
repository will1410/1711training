# Patrons

## Holds history

When you view the patron's record in the staff client there will be a new tab for Holds History.

Click on the tab that says "Holds history"

![Holds history](../.gitbook/assets/1711-010.holdshistory.jpg)

Items that have not arrived will say "Pending." Items that have been filled will say "Fulfilled." Items that have been canceled will say "Canceled." Items that are waiting will say "Waiting."

Patrons cannot delete or anonymize their holds history - that function will also be in a future version
