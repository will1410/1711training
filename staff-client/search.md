## Pagination bar

The search results pages have always included a pagination bar at the bottom of the page.  It will now be repositioned so that it appears at the top and the bottom of the search results.

Both pagination bars will also now include a "Last" button.

### Add to

The add to cart/list dropdown has changed.  The new version will have separate buttons for the cart and lists instead of the dropdown.

The "Add to list" dropdown appears once you click on the button and the items are automatically saved to the list you select.

### Show all/local copies

The "Brief/Full Results" button has been restyled and is now called "Show all copies" or "Show local copies" depending on the circumstances.
