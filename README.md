## Upgrade on July 28, 2018

Sometime after 8:00 p.m. on July 28, 2018, we will be upgrading the NExpress/Next catalog from Koha 17.05 to Koha 17.11.

The new version does not have a number of significant changes for staff.  Most of the changes between these two versions involve behind-the-scenes changes to the internal architecture of the software -- changes to the underlying datbase and the structure of the code.

The release notes for this version can be found by clicking here:  [Koha 17.11 Release notes](https://koha-community.org/koha-17-11-released/)

Generally our support company, ByWater Solutions, keeps us 1 version behind the most cutting edge newest release.  This helps us avoid major bugs in the newest versions of the software.  Koha 18.05, for example, was released two months ago, but we will not be moving to Koha 18.05 until Koha 18.11 is released in the fall.  If you are interested in seeing what features will be coming in Koha 18.05, the release notes for Koha 18.05 can be found by clicking here:  [Koha 18.05 Release notes](https://koha-community.org/koha-18-05-released/).
