## Upgrade on July 28, 2018

Sometime after 8:00 p.m. on July 28, 2018, we will be upgrading the NExpress/Next catalog from Koha 17.05 to Koha 17.11.

The new version does not have a number of significant changes for staff.  Most of the changes between these two versions involve behind-the-scenes changes to the internal architecture of the software -- changes to the underlying datbase and the structure of the code.

The release notes for this version can be found by clicking here: [Koha 17.11 Release notes](https://koha-community.org/koha-17-11-released/)
